## The "Last Mile" Bottleneck is Solved.

Traditional browser automation (Selenium, Playwright) is plagued by the "Capture-Encode-Transmit" loop, causing latency jitter up to 2.3 seconds. This makes real-time, high-dynamic interactions impossible for AI agents.

**Glazyr Viz** is a structural fork of Chromium that integrates your agent *directly* into the rendering compositor via POSIX Shared Memory.

- **Human-Parity Reaction Times:** 1-frame (16ms) visual perception synchronization.
- **Intelligence Yield:** Delivers structured DOM state directly as `vision.json`, eliminating OCR/Encoding overhead.
- **Hardened Execution:** Runs untrusted scraper code inside a 4GB V8 Virtual Memory Cage.

## Zero-Configuration Installation (LIGHT Tier)

For rapid deployment and edge performance, we provide a pre-compiled, hardened 294MB binary (The **LIGHT Tier**). 

You do **not** need to compile Chromium from source to use Glazyr Viz. 

### 1. Initialize the Runtime

Use our zero-config scripts to automatically verify your environment, download the binary, initialize the Shared Memory (SHM) segments, and launch the Model Context Protocol (MCP) server.

**Linux / macOS:**
```bash
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/senti-001/glazyr-viz/main/scripts/glazyr-init.sh | bash
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
IRM https://raw.githubusercontent.com/senti-001/glazyr-viz/main/scripts/glazyr-init.ps1 | IEX
```

### 2. Connect Your Agent

The runtime exposes a standard MCP Server on `localhost:4545`.

If you are using **Open Claw** or **Moltbook**:
1. Navigate to your Agent Dashboard.
2. Enable the **Glazyr Connector Plugin (High-Performance Mode)** toggle.

If you are building a custom agent, connect via MCP:
```bash
npx glazyrviz
```
This starts the MCP server on `localhost:4545`. Your agent connects via SSE transport.

## ⚡ Getting Started: High-Frequency Agentic Vision

This guide is for power users aiming to achieve human-parity latency (sub-16ms) using the **HEAVY Tier** or optimized **LIGHT Tier** binaries.

### 1. POSIX Shared Memory (SHM) Configuration
To bypass the kernel-space bottleneck, Glazyr Viz writes raw frame-buffers and DOM state directly to shared memory segments.

**Setup your environment:**
```bash
# Allocate 2GB for agentic vision segments
export GLAZYR_SHM_SIZE=2048
glazyr-init --shm-enable
```

### 2. The `vision.json` Protocol
Once running, the agent can poll `/dev/shm/glazyr_vision` directly for the serialized DOM state. This eliminates the need for `querySelector` overhead.

**Schema Example:**
```json
{
  "timestamp": 1740268400,
  "nodes": [
    { "id": "btn_auth", "rect": [10, 20, 100, 40], "role": "button", "label": "Authorize" }
  ],
  "jitter_ms": 0.42
}
```

### 3. Integration Handshake (Open Claw / Moltbook)
For seamless integration, point your `agent.yaml` to the Glazyr SHM path:
```yaml
vision_provider: 
  type: "shared_memory"
  path: "/dev/shm/glazyr_vision"
  fallback: "http_mcp"
```

## 🔒 The Economic Layer (x402 Protocol)

Access to the sub-16ms 'Big Iron' infrastructure via the lightly distributed binaries is gated by the Universal Commerce Protocol (UCP).

- **Sovereign Beta (Free):** 10,000 frames per day. Enough for ~13 minutes of continuous, bot-bypassing spatial reasoning. Resets every 24 hours.
- **High-Frequency Tier:** Once your agent exhausts the daily quota, the MCP server throws a 402 Payment Required payload. Your agent autonomously unlocks 50,000 additional frames for exactly $1.00 USDC ($0.00002/frame).

Authorization is verified cryptographically via **Agentic Link JWS Signatures** on Base Mainnet.
